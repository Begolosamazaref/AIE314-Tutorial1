    "content": "World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It was one of the deadliest wars in history, involving many of the world's major powers. The war was primarily fought between the Allied Powers, including France, Britain, Russia, and later the United States, against the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire.\nThe immediate cause of the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo. This event triggered a series of political and military alliances that escalated into full-scale war. However, deeper causes included militarism, imperialism, nationalism, and complex alliances that had been brewing tensions for years.\nThe war was characterized by trench warfare, where soldiers on both sides faced horrific conditions, including mud, disease, and relentless artillery bombardments. Key battles such as the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Verdun resulted in massive casualties. New military technologies, including tanks, poison gas, and machine guns, changed the nature of warfare.\nIn 1917, the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies after German submarine attacks on American ships and the infamous Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany tried to persuade Mexico to join the war against the U.S. This shifted the balance in favor of the Allies.\nThe war ended on November 11, 1918, with the signing of an armistice. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 officially ended the conflict, imposing heavy penalties on Germany and redrawing national borders. However, the harsh terms of the treaty contributed to tensions that would later lead to World War II.\nWorld War I had a profound impact on the world, leading to the fall of empires, economic hardship, and significant social changes. It reshaped global politics and left a lasting legacy that influenced the course of the 20th century.\n"
